\subsection{Termination Proof}
\label{termination}

\newcommand{\degree}{\text{\it degree\/}}

For any list of equalities the unification algorithm always
terminates, either by returning their most general unifier or by
establishing that there is no unifier. The termination argument uses a
notion of \degree\ of a list of constraints $\mathbb{C}$, written as
$\degree(\mathbb{C})$, defined as a pair $(m,n)$, where $m$ is the
number of distinct type variables in $\mathbb{C}$ and $n$ is the total
size of the types in $\mathbb{C}$. We let $(m,n)\prec (m',n')$ denote
the usual lexicographic ordering of degrees.

Textbooks usually consider it straightforward that each clause of the
unification algorithm either terminates (with success or failure) or
else make a recursive call with a list of constraints that has a
lexicographically smaller degree. Since the implemented unification
function is defined by recursion over proofs of lexicographic ordering
of degrees, we must ensure that all recursive calls are made on
smaller lists of constraints.  In lines 3 and 4 of Figure
\ref{unifyalgorithm}, the recursive calls are made on a list of
constraints of smaller degree, because the list of constraints
$[\alpha\mapsto\tau]\mathbb{C}$ will decrease by one the number of
type variables occurring in it. This is formalized in the following
lemma:

\begin{Lemma}[Substitution application decreases degree]\label{lem-termination-1}
For all variables $\alpha \in \mathcal{V}$, all well-formed types
$\tau$ and well-formed lists of constraints $\mathbb{C}$, it holds
that 
  \[ \degree([\alpha\mapsto \tau]\,\mathbb{C})\prec 
     \degree((\alpha \eeq \tau) :: \mathbb{C})\]
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
Induction over $\mathbb{C}$. 
% and the lexicographic product definition. hm?
\end{proof}

On line 5 of Figure \ref{unifyalgorithm}, we have that the recursive
call is made on a constraint that has more equalities than the
original but has a smaller degree, as shown by the following lemma.

\begin{Lemma}[Fewer Arrows implies lower degree]\label{lem-termination-2}
For all well-formed types $\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_1', \tau_2'$ and all well-formed lists of constraints $\mathbb{C}$, it holds that
\[\degree((\tau_1\eeq\tau_1',\tau_2\eeq\tau_2') :: \mathbb{C})
\prec
\degree((\tau_1\to\tau_2\eeq\tau_1'\to\tau_2') :: \mathbb{C})\]
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
Immediate from Lemma \ref{appsize}.
\end{proof}
Finally, the recursive calls in lines 2 and 6 also decrease the degree
of the input list of constraints, according to the following:

\begin{Lemma}[Less constraints implies lower degree]\label{lem-termination-3}
For all well-formed types $\tau$, $\tau'$ and all well-formed list of
constraints $\mathbb{C}$, it holds that 
  \[ \degree(\mathbb{C}) \prec \degree(\{\tau \eeq \tau'\} :: \mathbb{C})\]
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
Immediate from Lemma \ref{lengthsize}.
\end{proof}
