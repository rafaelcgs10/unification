\section{The Unification Algorithm}\label{algorithm-section}

We use the following standard presentation of the first-order
unification algorithm, where $\tau\equiv\tau'$ denotes a decidable
equality test between $\tau$ and $\tau'$:

\begin{figure}
\[
\small{
\begin{array}{ll}
(1) & \unify([\: ]) = [\: ]\\
(2) & \unify((\alpha \eeq \alpha) :: \mathbb{C}) = \unify(\mathbb{C})\\
(3) & \unify((\alpha \eeq\tau) :: \mathbb{C}) = 
      \If \occurs(\alpha,\tau) \Then \fail \Else \unify([\alpha\mapsto\tau]\mathbb{C})\circ [\alpha \mapsto \tau]\\
(4) & \unify((\tau \eeq\alpha) :: \mathbb{C}) = 
      \If \occurs(\alpha,\tau) \Then \fail \Else \unify([\alpha\mapsto\tau]\mathbb{C})\circ [\alpha \mapsto \tau]\\
(5) & \unify((\tau_1\to\tau_2 \eeq \tau\to\tau')::\mathbb{C}) = 
      \unify((\tau_1\eeq\tau)::(\tau_2\eeq\tau')::\mathbb{C}) \\
(6) & \unify((\tau \eeq \tau')::\mathbb{C}) = \If \tau\equiv\tau' \Then \unify(\mathbb{C}) \Else \fail 
\end{array}}
\]

\end{figure}

Our formalization differs from the presented algorithm (Figure
\ref{unifyalgorithm}) in two aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
     \item Since this presentation of the unification algorithm is
       general recursive, i.e.~there are recursive calls that are not
       made on structurally smaller arguments, we need to define it
       using recursion on proofs that $\unify$'s arguments form a
       well-founded relation~\ccite{Bertot04}.
    \item Instead of returning just a substitution that represents the
      argument constraint unifier, we return a proof that such
      substitution is indeed its most general unifier or a proof
      explaining that such unifier does not exist, when $\unify$
      fails.
\end{enumerate}

These two aspects are discussed in Sections \ref{termination} and
\ref{soundness}, respectively.

It is worth mentioning that there are some Coq extensions that make
the definitions of general recursive functions and functions defined
by pattern matching on dependent types easier, namely commands
\texttt{Function} and \texttt{Program}, respectively. However,
according to the Coq reference manual \cite{coq}, these are
experimental extensions. Thus, we prefer to use well established
approaches to overcome these problems: 1) use of a recursion principle
derived from the definition of a well-founded
relation~\ccite{Bertot04} and 2) annotate every pattern matching
construct in order to make explicit the relation between function
argument and return types.
